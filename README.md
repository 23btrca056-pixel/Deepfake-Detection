# Deepfake Detection Using CNN + RNN

## 📌 Overview
This project detects deepfake videos by analyzing facial features across multiple frames using a hybrid deep learning architecture.  
A CNN extracts spatial facial features from each frame, while an RNN (LSTM/GRU) analyzes temporal changes to identify inconsistencies that indicate a fake video.
